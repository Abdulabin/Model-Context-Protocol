To address this limitation, in this paper\\nwe present GreenTrainer, a new LLM fine-tuning technique that adaptively\\nevaluates different tensors\' backpropagation costs and contributions to the\\nfine-tuned model accuracy, to minimize the fine-tuning cost by selecting the\\nmost appropriate set of tensors in training. Such selection in GreenTrainer is\\nmade based on a given objective of FLOPs reduction, which can flexibly adapt to\\nthe carbon footprint in energy supply and the need in Green AI. Experiment\\nresults over multiple open-sourced LLM models and abstractive summarization\\ndatasets show that, compared to fine-tuning the whole LLM model, GreenTrainer\\ncan save up to 64% FLOPs in fine-tuning without any noticeable model accuracy\\nloss.
