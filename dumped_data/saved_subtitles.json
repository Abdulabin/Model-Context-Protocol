Talk Smart | Matt Abrahams | TEDxMontaVistaHighSchool\n\nSubtitles : 0.43 | [Applause]\n3.919 | people hate me\n5.839 | people fear me\n8.4 | you see\n9.599 | i'm a communication professor\n12.16 | and these people who fear me and hate me\n15.12 | are some of the brightest most creative\n18.0 | most entrepreneurial people i know\n22.32 | i wield a tool\n24.24 | and that tool i wield is what makes them\n27.279 | fear and despise me\n30.56 | as a professor i have the ability to do\n32.96 | what's called cold calling\n35.12 | that's where i look at a student and say\n36.96 | what do you think\n38.559 | what do you feel about what we just\n40.079 | discussed\n41.44 | how does this impact you and this causes\n46.079 | panic\n48.0 | not just for my students\n50.16 | but for everybody\n52.079 | that moment where we are called upon to\n54.399 | speak articulately\n56.879 | can we do it\n59.039 | now rest assured i never cold call on my\n61.92 | students\n63.039 | i think it's rude and i know it's hard\n66.88 | but people fear it\n69.119 | 85\n71.6 | of people say they fear speaking in\n74.08 | public and quite frankly i think the\n76.0 | other 15 percent are lying\n78.08 | i think we could find a situation that\n80.4 | makes them nervous too\n82.88 | so today my goal is to share with you\n85.84 | some tips and techniques that you can\n87.84 | use\n88.72 | to help you be more comfortable and\n90.64 | confident when you're speaking\n92.799 | in other words to be able to think fast\n95.68 | and talk smart\n97.84 | to do this we're going to look at four\n99.52 | different steps\n101.36 | first we're going to talk about the\n102.64 | approach we take\n104.72 | then we'll speak about the audience we\n106.399 | talk to\n107.6 | the context in which we find ourselves\n110.079 | and finally\n111.92 | the structures we used to help our\n114.079 | messages get across\n116.799 | so let's start by talking about approach\n120.479 | you know i was reminded about the\n122.079 | importance of approach\n124.079 | many many years ago when my wife and i\n126.079 | first moved in with each other you see\n128.479 | we fought a lot\n130.319 | over little things\n132.8 | things mostly that happened in our\n134.56 | bathrooms we called these our bathroom\n136.879 | brawls as the toilet seat up as the\n138.48 | toilet seat down\n140.08 | by far the biggest fight my wife and i\n142.16 | ever had\n143.84 | was over toothpaste\n147.12 | you see my wife's a roller and i'm a\n149.44 | squeezer\n151.76 | and all of you out there who are rollers\n153.44 | i appreciate the fine artwork you create\n155.92 | out of your toothpaste\n157.44 | but you know\n158.72 | that the most\n159.92 | awful thing that can happen to you is to\n162.239 | have a squeezer come by and ruin\n165.04 | all that effort you've put in but to me\n166.8 | getting toothpaste out of a toothpaste\n168.16 | tube is an act of aggression i feel\n169.76 | powerful in the morning in the evening\n173.2 | and we would fight incessantly over\n175.12 | little things like this and finally my\n176.72 | wife who is much smarter than i\n179.36 | said time out what are we doing here\n181.92 | we've just been married we love each\n183.28 | other and yet we're fighting all the\n184.4 | time we need to look at this differently\n187.28 | and as soon as we started looking at our\n190.319 | bathroom brawls\n192.72 | as\n193.599 | opportunities opportunities to learn\n195.92 | about each other\n197.2 | to make concessions to collaborate\n200.159 | things changed\n201.76 | and i'm happy to say after 15 years of\n204.239 | marriage we no longer fight over\n206.08 | toothpaste\n208.72 | this same approach is true in\n210.799 | communication most of us when we are in\n213.36 | situations where we need to communicate\n216.879 | we see them as threatening\n219.36 | we see them as opportunities for failure\n222.64 | and i'd like to suggest that we need to\n224.159 | change that\n225.44 | we need to approach communication in an\n227.599 | open way see it as an opportunity to\n230.08 | share our ideas our beliefs our\n231.84 | innovations\n233.36 | and when we take a perspective of\n235.36 | openness\n236.799 | all of a sudden something that we dread\n239.599 | becomes something that we embrace\n242.0 | so the first step to effective\n243.76 | communication is to approach it in an\n246.319 | open way\n248.799 | but that's not enough\n250.64 | we need to think about the audience that\n253.28 | we're speaking to\n255.92 | and to me the way to approach it is the\n257.919 | opposite the way most people do\n261.04 | most of us think about here's what i\n263.36 | want to say or here's what i need to say\n266.56 | i would suggest that's exactly wrong you\n269.04 | need to think about what does my\n270.639 | audience need to hear\n274.639 | and it sounds just like verbal jujitsu\n276.56 | where i'm moving words around but in\n278.32 | fact it's a fundamental difference\n280.639 | if i ask myself what does my audience\n282.72 | need it puts me in service of my\n284.96 | audience\n286.0 | it's about their needs\n288.16 | and in order to understand those needs i\n290.16 | have to do some reconnaissance i have to\n292.56 | ask myself who they are\n296.08 | the three things i think we need to ask\n298.32 | about our audience are what is their\n300.72 | knowledge what is it that they know\n304.56 | and if they don't know enough what can\n306.16 | we do to scaffold that information\n308.8 | so that they have the tools they need\n311.44 | in addition to knowledge we need to be\n313.199 | thinking about their expectations\n316.24 | and by expectations i mean what is it\n318.479 | that they\n320.16 | expect of me\n322.4 | most audiences have heard the types of\n324.639 | presentations you're giving maybe it's a\n327.039 | pitch\n328.4 | maybe it's some kind of advertisement or\n330.88 | marketing maybe it's a ted talk\n333.6 | your audience has heard those kind of\n335.36 | presentations before so what do they\n337.68 | expect of you\n339.36 | and then you can choose to conform to\n340.8 | those expectations or not\n343.36 | you know i have two young kids and i\n345.84 | learned that sometimes violating their\n347.759 | expectations actually is the most\n349.68 | effective thing i can do for the\n350.96 | communication we need\n353.84 | my boys sometimes make me upset\n356.319 | and when they make me upset i used to\n358.08 | raise my voice\n359.52 | to no avail\n361.039 | nothing happened i was ignored\n363.52 | and that's tough for a communication guy\n365.759 | so what i started to do\n367.52 | when i'm really upset with my boys\n369.84 | i lower my voice\n372.88 | and they stop dead in their tracks\n376.0 | violating expectations sometimes can\n378.16 | actually help you as a communicator\n380.8 | the final thing we need to think about\n382.96 | are what are their attitudes\n385.28 | the way you approach your communication\n387.36 | is influenced by what your audience\n389.68 | thinks about what you're talking on are\n391.759 | they in favor of it are they against it\n393.84 | are they hesitant agnostic those are the\n396.16 | things you need to be asking yourself\n398.639 | when you communicate\n400.24 | so we need to appreciate our audience\n404.479 | when my older child was in kindergarten\n407.68 | i volunteered i came into his classroom\n410.639 | the teacher had to leave to take a call\n412.24 | or something and i was in charge of an\n414.639 | art project\n416.56 | oh was that a mistake\n419.12 | the kids were running around i was\n420.56 | saying oh stop this johnny sally stop\n422.08 | doing that nobody listened\n425.28 | the yoda-like teacher returned\n427.919 | saw the chaos that had ensued in her\n430.08 | brief absence\n431.52 | and simply looked at the children and\n433.12 | started rewarding the positive behavior\n437.199 | janet she said\n438.88 | what a lovely way you've cleaned up your\n440.639 | crayons\n442.8 | samuel\n443.84 | thank you so much for walking with the\n446.16 | scissors\n448.96 | the students stopped in their tracks\n451.28 | changed their behavior\n452.96 | i learned then\n454.479 | that you need to understand your\n456.0 | audience and what they need and to this\n458.319 | day i try to apply those principles\n461.52 | i also learned that i could never teach\n463.12 | elementary school students if guilt and\n465.36 | shame doesn't work i can't teach them\n468.96 | so knowing your audience\n470.96 | really matters\n472.4 | but beyond knowing your audience you\n474.08 | have to appreciate the context in which\n476.56 | you speak\n477.759 | whenever you speak you are in a\n479.68 | particular context and to me context\n482.319 | comes in a bunch of different varieties\n484.4 | the first thing about context we need to\n486.16 | think about is the time\n487.919 | what time of day are you communicating\n491.28 | if you're talking early in the morning\n493.68 | you might have to have a little more\n494.879 | energy to keep people moving same thing\n496.96 | after lunch when people are having that\n498.72 | food coma experience\n501.919 | i taught high school many many years ago\n504.319 | and i don't think my principal liked me\n506.16 | very much\n507.199 | because she gave me freshmen\n509.36 | right before lunch\n510.879 | and right after lunch and if you know\n512.959 | anything about 14 15 year old kids they\n515.76 | need lots of food and lots of social\n517.919 | experience\n519.2 | so by the time my first class of\n521.12 | freshmen came to me after four hours of\n523.279 | class\n524.399 | they were dead tired they could barely\n526.64 | move let alone think\n529.04 | right after lunch when my second batch\n530.8 | joined me\n532.0 | they were amped up on their food their\n534.32 | caffeine their friends it was a frenzy\n537.2 | in my classroom and i had to teach them\n539.44 | the same thing\n541.76 | how did i do it i changed the way\n544.72 | we approached the class\n547.279 | the class before lunch was highly\n548.8 | collaborative people were moving around\n550.399 | lots of activities after lunch\n552.64 | a little more mellow you must address\n555.519 | the context the timing so your message\n558.16 | can be effective\n561.12 | context also involves emotion\n564.0 | most of us when we communicate we think\n566.64 | about information what's in my head in\n568.8 | my heart i need to communicate to you\n571.2 | but we also communicate a feeling\n573.839 | maybe we're trying to get people excited\n575.519 | and motivate them\n577.279 | maybe we're trying to scare them create\n578.959 | that burning platform that motivates\n581.519 | them to change\n582.8 | sometimes we're just trying to instill\n584.24 | confidence you should believe in what\n585.6 | i'm saying\n586.8 | but we need to think about the emotion\n588.8 | as well as the information\n593.279 | the final bit of\n594.959 | context has to do with where you're\n596.8 | physically speaking\n599.04 | location matters\n602.0 | just the other day i read in the\n603.44 | newspaper\n604.399 | that the girl scout in the state of\n606.64 | california this year who sold the most\n609.68 | cookies during the girl scouts annual\n611.68 | cookie drive\n613.04 | set up shop\n614.48 | in front of a medical marijuana\n616.079 | dispensary\n618.64 | she sold more cookies than anybody\n621.519 | location matters\n623.92 | think about the way the room is set up\n625.6 | think about the environment is it live\n627.36 | is it virtual\n628.72 | those change the way that you\n630.64 | communicate we need to think about\n633.44 | location\n636.079 | so our approach is important\n638.399 | our audience is important\n640.48 | the context in which we find ourselves\n642.8 | is important\n644.88 | and so too is the way we structure our\n646.8 | messages\n650.32 | it is much easier for humans to\n652.72 | understand information when it is\n654.72 | structured\n656.079 | in fact we remember information up to 40\n658.24 | percent better when it's structured\n661.36 | what do i mean by this\n663.04 | some of you listening are too young to\n665.279 | remember but those of us of my age when\n668.079 | we wanted to call somebody on the phone\n670.72 | we actually had to remember a phone\n672.44 | number my kids today they look at a\n674.88 | picture push a button and the other\n676.079 | person starts talking on the phone we\n678.64 | had it much harder\n680.32 | we had to remember 10 digits 10 digits\n682.64 | are hard to remember so what did we do\n684.56 | we put them in a structure\n686.24 | 3 3 and four\n688.88 | that's how we remembered\n690.48 | that's what i mean by a structure the\n692.16 | information is put in a way that it\n694.32 | makes it easy not only for you as a\n696.16 | speaker but also for the audience to\n697.839 | remember\n700.32 | now\n701.68 | i have lots of favorite structures you\n704.24 | see some of the structures up here\n705.6 | behind me the first structure\n708.0 | is a chronological structure past\n710.56 | present future here's how things used to\n712.56 | be here's how they are today here's\n714.48 | where they're going in the future a\n716.48 | chronological structure can really help\n718.8 | you\n719.519 | navigate\n720.88 | your audience from one place to the next\n723.519 | quite frankly structure sets\n725.2 | expectations\n726.88 | you can't be lost\n729.2 | if you have a map\n730.639 | your structure provides a map and the\n732.639 | chronological structure is incredibly\n734.56 | helpful for that\n737.12 | the next structure\n738.88 | happens to be the problem solution\n740.959 | benefits structure this is one of the\n743.12 | most persuasive structures out there you\n745.839 | start by explaining what the issue is\n747.839 | you talk about how to solve it and then\n749.68 | the benefits to the people\n753.44 | finally my favorite structure\n756.0 | the one that i use the most i call this\n758.56 | the macgyver of all structures\n761.12 | this can get you through any situation\n764.16 | is the what so what\n766.48 | now what structure you start by telling\n768.8 | people what the issue is\n770.8 | you tell them why it's important in that\n772.48 | so what step and then you tell them\n774.32 | what's next what's coming\n776.399 | it's like a swiss army knife you can use\n778.16 | it in situations if you're teaching\n780.56 | you can use it if you are trying to\n782.32 | motivate people\n784.079 | and you can use it even if you're\n785.36 | introducing somebody change the what to\n787.839 | a who and you've got your introduction\n793.04 | structure helps keep your audience\n795.12 | together and in line\n797.6 | when i was an undergraduate i was a tour\n799.92 | guide\n800.8 | it was the highest paying job on campus\n802.72 | and boy did i need money\n804.959 | i trained for 12 weeks to be a tour\n807.68 | guide\n808.48 | i learned lots of interesting some would\n811.12 | say useless facts about my university\n814.32 | thing they drilled into our heads\n815.519 | besides how to walk backwards which to\n817.279 | this day i still can do in a straight\n818.8 | line\n820.24 | the most important thing they taught us\n822.399 | they said above all else to be a great\n824.56 | tour guide at this institution\n827.04 | is to never\n828.56 | lose your audience you are a bad tour\n831.92 | guide if your tour group gets lost\n834.959 | the same is true\n836.399 | when you're speaking\n837.76 | structure keeps people together\n840.639 | we need structure\n844.88 | so we see here\n847.04 | that these tools\n849.12 | the tools that help us get\n851.36 | our audience engaged and involved and\n853.76 | help us convey our message\n856.16 | are the same tools that help my students\n860.48 | learn to love speaking and learn to do\n863.12 | it well\n864.88 | it's about the approach you take\n867.04 | the audience\n868.72 | the context\n870.399 | and the structure\n872.079 | now i'm always looking for examples of\n874.24 | this to help people understand and the\n876.0 | other day i was eating breakfast\n878.0 | and i looked across the table at my soy\n880.0 | milk\n880.959 | and i said you know what\n882.639 | this is a great example\n885.279 | think about it\n886.72 | silk soy milk\n890.72 | silk soy milk\n892.24 | is targeted to a very specific audience\n895.92 | people who are interested in eating\n897.44 | healthy\n899.279 | or people who are lactose intolerant\n902.959 | the name is a combination of the word\n905.92 | soy and milk\n908.079 | silk\n909.6 | it speaks to the audience's desire to\n911.519 | have something rich something expensive\n913.92 | something yummy\n917.6 | it's\n918.88 | at a time and a context in an\n921.279 | environment if you notice where you buy\n923.12 | silk soy milk it's next to other milk\n925.839 | that's not where it was originally it\n927.76 | used to be in the health food aisle now\n930.0 | it's next to milk they marketed it and\n932.24 | boxed it the way milk is\n935.12 | the structure of the name\n937.04 | is very compelling let's face it they\n939.279 | could have called it\n941.12 | moy\n943.6 | and nobody would have bought it right\n946.48 | so if you get the message right\n949.12 | and you communicate it effectively\n951.839 | you can make a big difference\n955.6 | so i want for you\n957.279 | what i wish for all of my students\n960.399 | bold communication that's confident and\n963.279 | compelling\n964.72 | and i want for your message to echo long\n967.36 | after you leave the room\n969.44 | and these are skills that are at your\n971.12 | disposal it just takes practice\n974.0 | and a little bit of a positive approach\n976.72 | thank you\n",
    "JpYA7WXkHyI": "Title: How to be a creative thinker | Carnegie Mellon University Po-Shen Loh\n\nSubtitles : 0.0 | [Music]\n1.48 | people used to go to school to learn how\n3.36 | to do the homework and do the exams\n5.56 | today everyone needs to learn how to\n8.0 | grade the homework this is the huge\n10.48 | difference because someday if you want\n12.799 | to do anything in the world the first\n14.16 | thing you will do is you will ask chg PT\n16.4 | the role of a person in the world is\n18.32 | going to be to solve problems so that's\n20.8 | why what the world needs now is a large\n23.48 | scale way for everyone to learn how to\n25.76 | come up with their own way of thinking\n27.88 | not just how to do the problems\n30.599 | hi I'm po sheno I'm a mathematician I'm\n33.559 | a math professor at Carnegie melon\n35.16 | University I'm a social entrepreneur and\n37.719 | I'm also the national coach of the US\n39.8 | International math Olympia\n44.64 | team if you have six match sticks how\n48.84 | can you put them so that they make four\n51.92 | triangles four triangles where the side\n54.76 | of the triangle is the same length as\n56.96 | the match stick so if you have six of\n58.879 | them you might start with putting three\n60.6 | of them like this okay but then you only\n63.48 | have three more now what okay it turns\n67.159 | out that the answer is that you take the\n69.4 | three match sticks like this and then\n71.479 | you use one more up here and you put it\n74.36 | down like a pyramid that's a thinking\n76.2 | outside the box if you if you can call\n78.119 | it that because this is not just on a\n79.799 | piece of paper anymore it's still six\n82.119 | match sticks or six toothpicks but it's\n84.28 | not what you were thinking of I've done\n86.159 | lots of different kinds of teaching I\n87.96 | teach people all the way from the\n89.479 | international math Olympia team I will\n91.88 | also go to schools and teach sixth grade\n94.84 | in schools where unfortunately there\n97.159 | might not even be any math teacher for\n98.72 | the whole seventh grade so I go and\n100.52 | cover the entire range of Education I\n102.88 | find this to be very interesting because\n105.159 | that helps me to learn what the\n106.64 | challenges are the whole point of a\n108.24 | school math test is to see whether or\n109.88 | not you listened and you practiced in\n112.439 | fact all the math comp competition\n114.24 | problems in the US and also in many\n116.2 | parts of the world are of this type\n118.28 | which is why today the way that I\n119.88 | approach Education and Training is to\n122.28 | try to help as many people as possible\n125.2 | learn how to do those questions which\n127.719 | they won't have seen before but I want\n129.679 | to emphasize the reason I I've been\n131.36 | doing a lot of work on this nowadays is\n133.52 | because when I was doing math\n135.48 | competitions in the 1980s the way you\n137.72 | got good at it was by thinking every\n140.879 | problem which was new was a chance to\n143.36 | practice mental flexibility today\n146.76 | unfortunately there's a huge industry\n149.08 | around test preparation and cramming\n152.599 | where people try to help students get\n155.44 | high scores on these strange Math\n157.68 | Questions by showing you all of the\n160.28 | strange math questions that you might\n161.959 | possibly see and that involves studying\n164.319 | for many many many many hours so that\n166.84 | the hope of the parents is that when the\n169.0 | students see the test questions they are\n171.8 | never surprised that they have done\n173.519 | everything many many many times by the\n175.64 | way as you may know this causes students\n177.599 | to have to go to school and after school\n179.64 | and so many hours is actually very bad\n181.8 | for the student but even worse it takes\n184.44 | away the students chance to\n190.12 | invent money doesn't buy you happiness\n192.72 | but money is important for impact and\n195.08 | influence so in fact it's very important\n197.4 | that the things that we build are\n198.76 | capable of generating enough money to\n200.84 | create the impact this just happens to\n202.76 | be what drives me 10 years ago I had\n206.0 | this crazy idea that maybe if we made a\n208.84 | website that would collect people's ways\n211.04 | of explaining math and science topics\n213.28 | then maybe people would explain the math\n215.439 | and science topics and it would be free\n217.159 | and everyone would be able to learn math\n218.56 | and science and I remember thinking oh\n220.599 | that can't be very hard we'll be done\n222.319 | with that in a few months I'm glad I\n224.56 | thought that because I'm still working\n226.4 | so I had this whole thing called XP we\n228.319 | were making a website with free\n229.72 | explanations but that didn't actually\n231.319 | have business model of its own it wasn't\n233.48 | generating money so I had to find some\n235.76 | way to support all of that in 2019 in\n238.159 | April we started creating our own\n240.439 | version of that in the United States of\n242.079 | America where we took charge of filming\n244.439 | me teaching and then we had a a product\n247.319 | which would consisted of me teaching\n249.439 | math that people could watch recordings\n251.4 | of and they would pay for it and this\n252.92 | this made some amount of money but then\n254.68 | this one we still found their repain\n256.079 | points and finally about 2 years ago I\n258.6 | realized you know what what people\n261.12 | really want is to have a live Human\n265.0 | Experience with somebody else who is an\n267.639 | expert the only problem is that's quite\n269.28 | rare and hard to find uh and there's\n270.96 | also another challenge which is that\n272.32 | ideally that person you're talking to is\n274.199 | friendly uh if the person knows a lot\n276.08 | but is not friendly that's actually not\n277.759 | useful either right this is the hardest\n279.759 | thing to deliver in education because\n281.52 | it's the least scalable of course in\n283.4 | entrepreneurship world we always think\n284.759 | about scalability and yes you can find\n287.0 | one brilliant coach who teaches 10\n290.199 | students or maybe even 20 or maybe even\n292.24 | even 100 that's a small scale uh\n294.12 | compared to the size of the world and\n295.84 | then that's when I suddenly realized I\n297.28 | can make a giant win-win win situation\n299.36 | so the main thing that I do now is an\n301.88 | ecosystem It's actually an ecosystem\n303.96 | that I invented which unites many\n306.88 | different types of people to all\n309.16 | contribute in ways where everyone is\n311.28 | winning one paino which was for the\n312.88 | people learning math then the second\n314.68 | paino was from the people who are very\n316.919 | very strong at math already for which\n318.68 | building the EQ would be even better\n320.36 | although I do want to emphasize this is\n322.12 | helping them finish up to become\n324.12 | extraordinary and the thing that made me\n325.96 | realize the key that made me realize I\n327.479 | could put everything together was an\n329.08 | experience that I had about 5 6 years\n331.28 | ago which is that I also took\n333.039 | improvisational comedy classes myself\n335.56 | improvisational comedy classes are\n337.16 | acting classes and I was doing that\n339.68 | because I was trying to learn how to\n340.88 | communicate better to get more people\n342.4 | interested in math but I realized that\n344.24 | even a math nerd like me can take those\n346.24 | classes and then become able to talk to\n348.56 | a few more people so then I realized let\n350.88 | me add that and then I walked over to\n353.199 | our drama department and I found out\n355.6 | that actually there are lots of people\n357.28 | who have extraordinary drama skills who\n359.72 | are actually indeed very interested in\n361.52 | paid part-time jobs to help to coach the\n364.12 | high school students so that's the third\n365.919 | pain point the third pain point is there\n367.199 | are people who absolutely love what\n368.88 | they're they're passionate about what\n370.08 | they're doing in the acting and drama\n371.599 | world but there's a practical need which\n373.919 | is well how to find a stable part-time\n376.84 | job flexible hours that they can use to\n379.12 | support their passions so suddenly\n381.319 | win-win-win we have all three lined up\n383.28 | and that's why this thing scales\n385.24 | actually the everyone winning is very\n386.52 | important because I work with high\n387.68 | school students and so in our in our\n389.319 | company\n390.36 | anytime anyone wants to ask high school\n392.52 | students to do anything my answer to my\n394.759 | employees is always that thing you want\n396.72 | to ask that high schooler to do can we\n399.28 | explain to their parent why for a very\n402.0 | busy high school student that thing is\n403.68 | the best thing they can do with their\n405.039 | time if I cannot explain that they're\n406.919 | not doing it so this this is the\n408.52 | discipline that we run it to this is\n409.96 | this is how strongly we make it a\n411.4 | win-win situation we will never have a\n413.36 | high school student doing something\n414.919 | unless I could explain myself to their\n416.8 | parent we suggested for your daughter to\n418.84 | do this because it's really good for her\n420.68 | to do this the thing is beforehand it\n423.68 | was hard to imagine there would be a way\n425.28 | to do that until the answer became oh\n427.4 | yeah because while doing this they will\n429.0 | get to learn from a Broadway or\n430.44 | Hollywood quality actor or actress\n432.4 | that's going to help them become\n433.56 | extraordinarily successful now win but\n436.319 | you see this took 8 years to come up\n437.84 | with two more years to scale the speed\n439.96 | at which we grow is purely just based on\n442.4 | how long it takes for people who have\n444.28 | middle school children to realize that\n446.36 | oh there are these classes here where\n448.12 | the class looks as good as a twitch\n449.639 | gaming stream and it's taught by math\n451.44 | geniuses who are smiling you know these\n453.28 | are things that people could not imagine\n455.24 | that You' put all together at the same\n456.68 | time and as people discover this they\n458.68 | actually switch over they start joining\n460.0 | our classes then we can bring more high\n461.599 | school students and the scaling power\n463.319 | this can go to Is We I estimate that\n466.08 | this easily could grow to 100,000 high\n468.08 | school students in the US that's 1% of\n470.159 | the US high school students teaching\n471.96 | about a million middle school students\n473.919 | if you look at our live program it looks\n476.199 | a little strange because you'll see that\n477.759 | the only subjects that we teach is a\n479.72 | pretty small number algebra geometry\n482.759 | combinatorics number Theory why do we\n485.479 | cover these we cover these because these\n487.96 | are a curriculum that teaches you how to\n489.919 | think the only way to do that is by\n492.159 | giving them questions that they have\n493.84 | never seen in school before so I need to\n495.84 | find a source of problems that you will\n498.0 | not see in school actually that turns\n500.639 | out to be the middle school math\n502.28 | competition curriculum because the\n503.96 | people making those problems were trying\n506.039 | to make problems that you don't see in\n507.56 | school but the difference between the\n509.639 | way we do it and the way that lots of\n511.28 | the training centers do it is that we\n513.399 | are trying to use those as opportunities\n515.839 | to make you able to practice the\n517.76 | thinking instead of just showing you\n519.68 | doing the question that weigh enough\n521.159 | time so the answer is the topics that we\n523.839 | cover specifically chosen because that\n526.08 | will be enough to teach a student how to\n528.24 | generate their own idea our philosophy\n530.36 | is if you finish all of that you will\n532.399 | discover that you can learn anything our\n534.32 | goal is not to make it so that we have\n536.24 | classes for you for every year of your\n538.48 | life our goal is to make it so that as\n541.0 | fast as possible you don't need any\n542.68 | classes from anyone ever\n547.399 | again today everyone needs to learn how\n550.48 | to grade the homework this is the huge\n553.36 | difference because someday if you want\n555.68 | to do anything in the world the first\n557.04 | thing you will do is you will ask chat\n558.68 | GPT let me make this analogy stronger if\n561.6 | we look at any good software engineer\n564.0 | most good software Engineers if they're\n566.72 | given a task that they have never done\n568.44 | before the first thing they do is to\n570.8 | think about some similar problems and\n572.6 | search on stack Overflow to see examples\n575.44 | they don't expect that will give them\n576.6 | the whole code they need to write but\n578.12 | they use this to research what kinds of\n579.959 | Technologies might be useful but as chat\n582.399 | GPT suggests the solutions they need to\n584.399 | be quick thinkers and analytical\n586.12 | thinkers to understand whether or not\n588.0 | what chat GPT said is correct so that's\n590.8 | why what the world needs now is a large\n593.48 | scale way for everyone to learn how to\n596.64 | grade homework for everyone to learn how\n598.56 | to come up with their own way of\n600.04 | thinking not just how to do the problems\n603.399 | my general philosophy is when you're\n604.839 | learning you should keep challenging and\n606.519 | you should not be repeating in the real\n608.32 | world when you're doing a task if it's\n610.2 | repetitive you should get chat GPT to do\n612.279 | it or a calculator to do it or a\n613.88 | computer to do it but in order to know\n616.2 | how to control those well in the real\n618.24 | world you need to learn how to think and\n620.88 | that's the purpose of the learning\n622.6 | process what I do for fun is I like to\n625.76 | meet and try to understand people whose\n628.88 | background I don't fully understand yet\n631.399 | this is actually what I do for fun this\n633.24 | is also why we're we're we're talking\n635.24 | right now I happen to be talking to you\n636.76 | in New York City the way I got here\n638.8 | overnight is I took the bus the\n640.88 | overnight bus you know some people don't\n642.839 | take the overnight bus because who knows\n644.6 | who you're taking the bus with but for\n646.639 | me I'm actually not scared by that\n648.36 | that's just called real world you can't\n650.76 | understand the real world unless you\n652.0 | actually start going into various parts\n653.959 | of the real world I think my message of\n656.0 | how to create value is you cannot create\n658.36 | value if you don't interact with people\n661.32 | you cannot just theoretically think\n662.76 | about the value and the more people the\n664.76 | more you can understand people of\n666.32 | different backgrounds understand means\n668.0 | have some idea of how they tick what are\n670.68 | their needs what are the limiting\n672.079 | factors what do they want to do the\n674.36 | better you are at modeling this the more\n676.279 | effective you will be at coming up with\n677.76 | a solution I started going to city after\n680.279 | city after City giving math talks in\n682.44 | public parks I actually set a schedule I\n685.04 | put a schedule on my website and I said\n686.88 | I'm going to go to all these cities and\n688.639 | people could just sign up to show up for\n690.04 | the talks and at the beginning people\n691.88 | were wondering will anyone show up but\n693.68 | actually there would be like 50 to 100\n695.56 | people showing up at these talks in\n697.399 | parks and by the way that was a fun\n698.839 | Journey because in order to do that I\n700.36 | was traveling around to from park to\n702.12 | park with all the AV Equipment speakers\n705.279 | and everything to be able to have a a\n707.399 | stage in in park shelters all around the\n710.0 | us but while doing that in inadvertently\n713.76 | that was customer Discovery because I\n715.959 | was able to suddenly interact with and\n718.12 | talk to thousand thousands of parents\n720.56 | and students which started to make me\n722.76 | realize what kind of challenges people\n724.839 | had and that's why just a probably about\n727.6 | one to two months after that the big\n729.8 | idea came the big idea of oh we can\n732.959 | actually have all these middle school\n734.44 | students who I've met they can all learn\n736.68 | how to think all at the same time while\n739.399 | these people who are brilliant become\n742.16 | extremely polished so that someday later\n744.519 | in their careers they can be really\n746.199 | successful so that that that was that\n748.16 | was the idea it was like somehow you\n749.839 | cannot really find pain points if you're\n753.12 | not seeing people that's also why with a\n755.68 | lot of the work that I do I will go into\n757.519 | schools right I love to work on\n759.44 | education and I do it in a way where\n762.16 | even just last night I was writing to\n763.92 | somebody who is involved with a large\n765.76 | network of schools and their schools I\n768.32 | believe serve students who are also\n770.88 | disadvantaged now instead of just\n773.24 | putting money or putting resources from\n774.88 | my side what I said is I'm very\n776.76 | interested can we arrange for me to go\n778.839 | into some of your schools and teach\n780.279 | sixth grade what I'm explaining is that\n782.68 | the way I do anything if I want to work\n784.44 | in a sector I go and myself step in and\n787.8 | start doing the work and see what\n789.36 | happens and this is actually how I came\n791.279 | up with all these ideas because actually\n792.959 | the ideas that I'm doing are all things\n794.72 | I've personally experienced myself I've\n796.92 | experienced being a math person taking\n799.079 | acting classes I've experienced being a\n801.68 | person learning how to think taught by\n803.24 | somebody who knows a lot of things and\n804.92 | also Smiles so all the different prcts\n807.92 | gave me these ideas\n811.12 | now I can understand why you identify\n814.6 | you as a social\n817.36 | entreprene yeah we're not doing a very\n819.279 | good job of maximizing lifetime customer\n821.6 | value if our goal is to solve the\n823.399 | customer's problem as fast as possible\n825.68 | but this is what we want to do right\n826.88 | this is the social entrepreneurship this\n828.399 | is also why if you ask me what is my\n830.44 | definition of success my definition of\n832.639 | success is not just that we make a ton\n834.48 | of money my definition of success is if\n836.519 | we manage to convince a huge number of\n838.68 | people this Earth to enjoy being\n841.079 | thoughtful than I want I love the fact\n844.199 | that entrepreneurship is about creating\n846.279 | new things so the message that I've been\n848.6 | sending in my entire tour is that this\n851.0 | new world of AI is going to be a wild\n853.48 | west there will be lots and lots of New\n855.6 | Opportunities the people who will be the\n857.48 | most successful are the ones who are\n859.639 | very good at creating value actually in\n861.6 | my public talks I tell everyone everyone\n863.959 | should be a bit of an entrepreneur they\n866.68 | can be an entrepreneur or they can even\n868.56 | be an entrepreneur which is a word in\n870.759 | English that we sometimes use to\n872.16 | describe making new things within an\n873.88 | organization but the whole concept of\n876.24 | creating value is actually going to be\n878.36 | Central in helping the society survive\n880.759 | and everyone flourish as we go forward\n882.68 | into this age of AI into this new Wild\n884.639 | blest\n",
    "arj7oStGLkU": "Title: Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator | Tim Urban | TED\n\nSubtitles : 12.559 | so in\n14.36 | college I was a government major which\n17.039 | means I had to write a lot of papers now\n19.64 | when a normal student writes a paper\n20.92 | they might spread the work out a little\n22.119 | like this so you\n25.96 | know you get started maybe a little\n28.0 | slowly but you get enough done in the\n29.359 | first week that that with some heavier\n30.96 | days later on everything gets done and\n33.16 | things stay\n34.92 | civil and I would want to do that like\n37.6 | that that would be the plan I would uh I\n40.719 | would have it all ready to go but then\n42.28 | then then actually the paper would would\n43.92 | come along and then I would kind of do\n47.76 | this and that would happen every single\n50.6 | paper but then came my 90 page senior\n54.559 | thesis a paper you're supposed to spend\n56.48 | a year on I knew for a paper like that\n59.16 | my normal work work flow was not an\n61.16 | option it was way too big a project so I\n63.12 | planned things out and I decided I kind\n65.239 | of had to go something like this this is\n68.0 | how the year would go so I'd start off\n70.28 | light and I'd bump it up in the middle\n72.68 | months and then at the end I would kick\n75.32 | it up into high gear it's just like a\n76.64 | little staircase how hard could it be\n78.32 | just walk up the stairs no big deal\n82.159 | right but then funniest thing happened\n84.92 | those first few months they came and\n87.2 | went and I I couldn't quite do stuff so\n89.56 | we had an awesome new revised\n91.72 | plan and\n94.68 | then but then those middle months\n96.96 | actually went by and I didn't really\n99.32 | write words and so we were here and then\n103.799 | two months turned into one month which\n106.119 | turned into two weeks and one day I woke\n108.719 | up with three days until the\n112.399 | deadline still not having written a word\n115.479 | and so I did the only thing I could I\n117.68 | wrote 90 pages over 72 hours hours\n120.2 | pulling not one but two allnighters\n122.399 | humans are not supposed to pull two\n125.439 | allnighters sprinted across campus dove\n128.56 | in slow motion and got it in just at the\n131.08 | deadline I thought that was the end of\n132.959 | everything but a week later I get a call\n135.68 | it's the\n136.76 | school and they say is this Tim Urban\n139.319 | and I say yeah and they say we need to\n141.64 | talk about your thesis and I say\n144.48 | okay and they say it's the best one\n147.8 | we've ever seen\n155.16 | [Applause]\n157.04 | that did not\n159.239 | happen it was a very very bad\n164.36 | thesis I just wanted to enjoy that one\n168.2 | moment when all of you thought this guy\n170.2 | is\n171.76 | amazing no no it was very very\n174.48 | bad anyway today I'm a writer blogger\n178.28 | guy I write the blog weight but why and\n181.239 | a couple years ago I decided to write\n182.84 | about procrastination my Behavior's\n184.879 | always perplexed the non-pr around me\n187.64 | and I wanted to explain to the non-rr\n189.4 | inators of the world what goes on in the\n192.04 | heads of procrastinators and why we are\n193.48 | the way we are now I had a hypothesis\n196.04 | that the the brains of procrastinators\n197.72 | were actually different than the brains\n199.959 | of other people and to test this I found\n203.239 | an MRI lab that actually let me scan\n205.239 | both my brain and the brain of a proven\n208.76 | non-prorated compare them and I actually\n211.04 | brought them here to show you today and\n212.64 | I want you to take a look carefully to\n214.04 | see if you can notice a difference and I\n215.48 | know that if you're not a trained brain\n216.879 | expert it's not that obvious but just\n218.879 | take a look okay so here's the brain of\n221.28 | a non-prorated\n239.84 | maker in them but the procrastinator's\n241.48 | brain also has an instant gratification\n244.36 | monkey now what does this mean for the\n246.0 | procrastinator well means everything's\n248.04 | fine until this\n251.12 | happens so the rational decision maker\n253.599 | will make the rational decision to do\n256.16 | something productive but the monkey\n257.88 | doesn't like that plan so he actually\n259.84 | takes the wheel and he says actually\n262.16 | let's read the entire Wikipedia page of\n263.919 | the Nancy Carri and Tanya Harding\n265.479 | Scandal cuz I just remember that that\n267.8 | happened then\n271.56 | then we're going to go over to the\n272.4 | fridge we're going to see if there's\n273.28 | anything new in there since 10 minutes\n275.0 | ago after that we're going to go on a\n278.199 | YouTube spiral that starts with videos\n280.44 | of Richard Fineman talking about magnets\n282.639 | and ends much much later with us\n284.4 | watching interviews with Justin Bieber's\n288.4 | mom all of that's going to take a while\n291.08 | so we're not going to really have room\n292.32 | on the schedule for any work today\n297.479 | sorry now what is going on\n302.479 | here the instag gratification monkey\n305.08 | does not seem like a guy you want behind\n306.88 | the wheel he lives entirely in the\n308.479 | present moment he has no memory of the\n310.8 | past no knowledge of the future and he\n312.56 | only cares about two things easy and fun\n316.44 | now in the animal world that works fine\n319.479 | if you're a dog and you spend your whole\n321.44 | life doing nothing other than easy and\n323.16 | fun things you're a huge\n325.52 | success and to the monkey\n329.96 | humans are just another animal species\n331.96 | you has to keep well slept well fed and\n334.0 | propagating into the Next\n335.68 | Generation which in tribal times might\n337.96 | have worked okay but if you haven't\n339.639 | noticed now we're not in tribal times\n341.759 | we're in an advanced civilization and\n343.759 | the monkey does not know what that is\n346.039 | which is why we have another guy in our\n347.479 | brain the rational decision maker who\n350.8 | gives us the ability to do things no\n352.56 | other animal can do we can visualize the\n355.28 | future we can see the big picture we can\n357.72 | make long-term plans and he wants to\n359.319 | take all all of that into\n361.16 | account and he wants to just have us do\n363.88 | whatever makes sense to be doing right\n366.24 | now now sometimes it makes sense to be\n368.4 | doing things that are easy and fun like\n370.56 | when you're having dinner or going to\n372.08 | bed or enjoying well earn leisure time\n374.4 | that's why there's an overlap sometimes\n376.4 | they agree but other times it makes much\n379.44 | more sense to be doing things that are\n382.56 | harder and Less Pleasant for the sake of\n384.639 | the big picture and that's when we have\n386.4 | a conflict and for the procrastinator\n389.12 | that conflict tends to end a certain way\n391.0 | every time leaving him spending a lot of\n393.199 | time in this orange Zone an easy and fun\n397.08 | place that's entirely out of the makes\n399.08 | sense Circle I call it the dark\n403.08 | Playground\n404.759 | now the dark playground is a place that\n407.4 | all of you procrastinators out there\n409.24 | know very well it's where leisure\n411.68 | activities happen at times when leisure\n413.599 | activities are not supposed to be\n415.4 | happening the fun you have in the dark\n417.52 | playground isn't actually fun because\n419.0 | it's completely unearned and the air is\n420.72 | filled with guilt dread anxiety\n423.28 | self-hatred all those good\n424.56 | procrastinator feelings and the question\n427.24 | is in this situation with the monkey\n429.039 | behind the wheel how does the\n430.36 | procrastinator ever get himself over\n432.199 | here to this Blue Zone a Less Pleasant\n434.639 | place but we really important things\n436.24 | happen Well turns out that the\n439.68 | procrastinator has a guardian angel\n442.16 | someone who's always looking down on him\n443.919 | and watching over him in his darkest\n446.12 | moments someone called the Panic monster\n454.72 | now the Panic monster is dormant most of\n458.0 | the time but he suddenly wakes up\n461.24 | anytime a deadline gets too close or\n463.36 | there's danger of public embarrassment a\n465.4 | career disaster or some other scary\n467.039 | consequence and importantly he's the\n469.319 | only thing that the monkey is terrified\n471.599 | of now he became very relevant in my\n474.44 | life pretty recently because people of\n477.4 | Ted reached out to me about months ago\n479.96 | and invited me to do a TED\n486.159 | talk now of course I said yes it's\n489.12 | always been a dream of mine to have done\n491.0 | a TED Talk in the\n495.21 | [Applause]\n503.159 | past but in the middle of all this\n505.0 | excitement the rational decision maker\n506.479 | seemed to have something else in his\n507.68 | mind he was saying are we\n510.159 | on what we just accepted do we do we get\n513.36 | what's going to be now happening one day\n515.0 | in the future we need to sit down and\n516.159 | work on this right now and the monkey\n518.24 | said totally agree but also let's just\n519.959 | open Google Earth and let's zoom into\n521.64 | the bottom of India like 200 feet above\n523.32 | the ground and we're going to scroll up\n524.32 | for two and a half hours till we get to\n526.04 | the top of the country so we can get a\n527.56 | better feel for\n534.12 | India so that's what we did that day\n538.19 | [Applause]\n540.839 | as six months turned into four and then\n543.04 | two and then one the people of Ted\n545.36 | decided to release the speakers and I\n547.959 | opened up the website and there was my\n549.839 | face staring right back at me and guess\n552.2 | who woke\n556.399 | up so the Panic monster starts losing\n559.12 | his mind and a few seconds later the\n561.04 | whole system's in\n566.519 | Mayhem and the monkey who remember he's\n568.76 | terrified at the Panic Monster boom he's\n570.44 | up the tree and finally finally the\n573.88 | rational decision maker can take the\n575.16 | wheel and I can start working on the\n576.64 | talk now the Panic monster explains all\n580.24 | kinds of pretty insane procrastinative\n582.839 | Behavior like how someone like me could\n584.279 | spend two weeks unable to start the\n587.399 | opening sentence of a paper and then\n589.68 | miraculously find the unbelievable work\n591.68 | work ethic to stay up all night and\n593.88 | write eight\n595.56 | pages and this entire situation with the\n598.64 | three characters this is the\n600.0 | procrastinator system it's not pretty\n603.0 | but in the end it works and this is what\n606.16 | I decided to write about on the blog\n608.399 | just a couple years ago now when I did I\n611.12 | was amazed by the response literally\n613.079 | thousands of emails came in from all\n615.16 | different kinds of people from all over\n616.6 | the world doing all different kinds of\n618.12 | things these were people who were nurses\n620.24 | and bankers and Painters and engineers\n622.2 | and lots and lots of PhD\n625.72 | students and they were all writing\n627.6 | saying the same thing I have this\n629.76 | problem too but what struck me was the\n631.92 | contrast between the light tone of the\n633.88 | post and the heaviness of these emails\n637.04 | these people were writing with intense\n639.639 | frustration about what procrastination\n641.6 | had done to their lives about what this\n643.44 | monkey had done to\n646.2 | them and I thought about this and I said\n650.079 | if the procrastinator system works then\n651.839 | what's going on why are all these people\n653.72 | in such a dark place Well turns out that\n656.24 | there's two kinds of procrastination\n660.0 | everything I've talked about today the\n661.16 | examples I've given they all have\n662.32 | deadlines and when there's deadlines the\n664.32 | effects of procrastination are contained\n666.88 | to the shortterm because the Panic\n668.48 | monster gets involved but there's a\n669.959 | second kind of procrastination that\n671.76 | happens in situations when there is no\n674.04 | deadline so if you want to have a career\n675.88 | where you want to be a selfstarter\n676.88 | something in the Arts something\n678.839 | entrepreneurial there's no deadlines on\n680.8 | those things at first because nothing's\n682.56 | happening at first not until you've gone\n684.279 | out and done the hard work to get some\n685.68 | momentum to get things going there's\n687.56 | also all kinds of important things\n688.76 | outside of your career that don't\n690.36 | involve any deadlines like seeing your\n692.04 | family or exercising and taking care of\n693.88 | your health working on your relationship\n696.36 | or getting out of a relationship that\n698.079 | isn't working now if procrastinator's\n701.56 | only mechanism of doing these hard\n704.2 | things is the Panic monster that's a\n706.079 | problem because in all of these non-\n707.519 | deadline situations the Panic monster\n710.2 | doesn't show up he has nothing to wake\n711.48 | up for so the effects of procrastination\n713.6 | they're not contained they just extend\n715.079 | outward\n716.959 | forever and it's this long-term kind of\n719.8 | procrastination that's much less visible\n722.399 | and much less talked about than the\n724.04 | funnier short-term deadline based kind\n726.76 | it's usually suffered quietly and\n729.839 | privately and it can be the source of a\n731.92 | huge amount of long-term unhappiness and\n735.639 | regrets and I thought you know that's\n737.68 | why these people are emailing and that's\n739.839 | why they're in such a bad place it's not\n742.279 | that they're cramming for some project\n744.88 | it's that long-term procrastination has\n746.56 | made them feel like a spectator at times\n748.48 | in their own lives you know the\n751.0 | frustration was not that they couldn't\n752.72 | achieve their dreams it's that they\n753.8 | weren't even able to start chasing them\n756.959 | so I read these emails and I had a\n759.68 | little bit of an\n761.36 | epiphany that I don't think nonpr\n763.839 | procrastinators exist that's right I\n766.959 | think all of you are\n768.88 | procrastinators now you might not all be\n770.76 | a mess like some of\n773.839 | us and some of you may have a healthy\n776.32 | relationship with deadlines but remember\n778.639 | the monkey sneakiest trick is when the\n781.16 | deadlines aren't there now I want to\n783.519 | show you one last thing I call this a\n786.68 | life calendar that's one box for every\n789.839 | week of a 90-year life that's not that\n794.0 | many boxes especially since we've\n796.639 | already used a bunch of those so I think\n799.32 | we need to all take a long hard look at\n802.6 | that\n803.92 | Calender and we need to think about what\n806.12 | we're really procrastinating on because\n808.12 | everyone is proc procrastinating on\n810.199 | something in\n811.76 | life we need to stay aware of the\n814.0 | instant gratification\n816.519 | monkey that's a job for all of us and\n821.04 | because there's not that many boxes on\n822.32 | there it's a job that should probably\n823.68 | start today well maybe not today\n829.0 | but you know sometime soon thank you\n840.279 | w\n"
